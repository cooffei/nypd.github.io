Russian FSB cyber actor Star
Blizzard continues worldwide
spear-phishing campaigns
The Russia-based actor is targeting organisations and
individuals in the UK and other geographical areas of
interest
Overview
The Russia-based actor Star Blizzard (formerly known as SEABORGIUM, also
known as Callisto Group/TA446/COLDRIVER/TAG-53/BlueCharlie) continues
to successfully use spear-phishing attacks against targeted organisations
and individuals in the UK, and other geographical areas of interest, for
information-gathering activity.
The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the US Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the US Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), the US National Security Agency (NSA), the US Cyber
National Mission Force (CNMF), the Australian Signals Directorate’s
Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC), the Canadian Centre for
Cyber Security (CCCS), and the New Zealand National Cyber Security
Centre (NCSC-NZ) assess that Star Blizzard is almost certainly subordinate
to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) Centre 18.
Industry has previously published details of Star Blizzard. This advisory
draws on that body of information.
This advisory raises awareness of the spear-phishing techniques Star
Blizzard uses to target individuals and organisations. This activity is
continuing through 2023.
Targeting profile
Since 2019, Star Blizzard has targeted sectors including academia, defence,
governmental organisations, NGOs, think tanks and politicians.
Targets in the UK and US appear to have been most affected by Star
Blizzard activity, however activity has also been observed against targets in
other NATO countries, and countries neighbouring Russia.
During 2022, Star Blizzard activity appeared to expand further, to include
defence-industrial targets, as well as US Department of Energy facilities.
Outline of the attacks
The activity is typical of spear-phishing campaigns, where an actor targets
a specific individual or group using information known to be of interest to
the targets. In a spear-phishing campaign, an actor perceives their target
to have direct access to information of interest, be an access vector to
another target, or both.
Research and preparation
Using open-source resources to conduct reconnaissance, including social
media and professional networking platforms, Star Blizzard identifies hooks
to engage their target. They take the time to research their interests and
identify their real-world social or professional contacts. [T1589; T1593]
Star Blizzard creates email accounts impersonating known contacts of
their targets to help appear legitimate. They also create fake social media
or networking profiles that impersonate respected experts [T1585.001] and
have used supposed conference or event invitations as lures.
Star Blizzard uses webmail addresses from different providers, including
Outlook, Gmail, Yahoo and Proton mail in their initial approach [T1585.002],
impersonating known contacts of the target or well-known names in the
target’s field of interest or sector.
To appear authentic, the actor also creates malicious domains resembling
legitimate organisations [T1583.001].
Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) provides a list of observed
Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) in their SEABORGIUM blog1
, but this is not
exhaustive.
Preference for personal email addresses
Star Blizzard has predominantly sent spear-phishing emails to targets’
personal email addresses, although they have also used targets’ corporate
or business email addresses. The actors may intentionally use personal
emails to circumvent security controls in place on corporate networks.
Building a rapport
Having taken the time to research their targets’ interests and contacts to
create a believable approach, Star Blizzard now starts to build trust. They
often begin by establishing benign contact on a topic they hope will
engage their targets. There is often some correspondence between
attacker and target, sometimes over an extended period, as the attacker
builds rapport.
Delivery of malicious link
Once trust is established, the attacker uses typical phishing tradecraft and
shares a link [T1566.002], apparently to a document or website of interest.
This leads the target to an actor-controlled server, prompting the target to
enter account credentials.
The malicious link may be a URL in an email message, or the actor may
embed a link in a document [T1566.001] on OneDrive, Google Drive, or other
file-sharing platforms.
Star Blizzard uses the open-source framework EvilGinx in their spearphishing activity, which allows them to harvest credentials and session
cookies to successfully bypass the use of two-factor authentication [T1539;
T1550.004].
Exploitation and further activity
Whichever delivery method is used, once the target clicks on the malicious
URL, they are directed to an actor-controlled server that mirrors the sign-in
page for a legitimate service. Any credentials entered at this point are now
compromised.
Star Blizzard then uses the stolen credentials to log in to a target’s email
account [T1078], where they are known to access and steal emails and
attachments from the victim’s inbox [T1114.002]. They have also set up mailforwarding rules, giving them ongoing visibility of victim correspondence
[T1114.003].
The actor has also used their access to a victim email account to access
mailing-list data and a victim’s contacts list, which they then use for followon targeting. They have also used compromised email accounts for further
phishing activity [T1586.002].
Conclusion
Spear-phishing is an established technique used by many actors, and Star
Blizzard uses it successfully, evolving the technique to maintain their
success.
Individuals and organisations from previously targeted sectors should be
vigilant of the techniques described in this advisory.
In the UK you can report related suspicious activity to the NCSC

Mitigation
A number of mitigations will be useful in defending against the activity
described in this advisory.
> Use strong passwords. Use a separate password for email accounts and
avoid password re-use across multiple services. See NCSC guidance:
https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/top-tips-for-staying-secureonline/use-a-strong-and-separate-password-for-email
> Use multi-factor authentication (/2-factor authentication/two-step
authentication) to reduce the impact of password compromises. See
NCSC guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/multi-factorauthentication-online-services and
https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/setting-two-factor-authentication-2fa
> Protect your devices and networks by keeping them up to date: use the
latest supported versions, apply security updates promptly, use anti-virus
and scan regularly to guard against known malware threats. See NCSC
guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/mobile-device-guidance/
antivirus-and-other-security-software
> Exercise vigilance. Spear-phishing emails are tailored to avoid suspicion.
You may recognise the sender’s name, but has the email come from an
address that you recognise? Would you expect contact from this person’s
webmail address rather than their corporate email address? Has the
suspicious email come to your personal/webmail address, rather than
your corporate one? Can you verify that the email is legitimate via another
means? See NCSC guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/phishing and https://
www.ic3.gov/Home/IndustryAlerts
> Enable your email providers’ automated email scanning features. These
are turned on by default for consumer mail providers. See NCSC guidance:
https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/telling-users-to-avoid-clicking-badlinks-still-isnt-working
> Disable mail-forwarding. Attackers have been observed to set up mailforwarding rules to maintain visibility of target emails. If you cannot
disable mail-forwarding, then monitor settings regularly to ensure that a
forwarding rule has not been set up by an external malicious actor.
